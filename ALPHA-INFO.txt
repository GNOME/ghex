GHex 4 alpha information
========================

GHex 4 is currently in alpha state.  As it has been substantially reworked
from GHex 3.x and, as of the time of writing, has only been recently merged to
the `master` branch (December 2021), it will require some substantial testing
and translation updates.

Visibly to the end user, some new features include:

 - More modern and up-to-date look and feel, consistent with the GNOME HIG.

 - Tabbed interface.

 - Dark Mode (by default, the GTK system-wide "prefer-dark-theme" setting is
   used, but can be overridden with a checkbox and a switch in the Preferences
   dialog).

 - libadwaita colour compatibility; if you use the Adwaita theme and GNOME
   apps that utilize libadwaita, GHex will (read: should) match the colour
   scheme. libadwaita is not a planned dependency for GHex at this time as many
   of its users are GTK users who do not run GNOME, and I want to keep GHex's
   dependency requirements to a minimum.

 - Custom clipboard data, for less error-prone copying and pasting of binary
   data; this will fall back to plaintext when unavailable.

 - Copy and Paste Special dialogs, which allow you to, for instance, copy and
   paste hex pairs from GHex into other applications, and to paste hex pairs
   from other applications into GHex.

I'll break up the known issues into two categories:  items I would consider to
be blockers for a beta, blockers for stable release, and other known issues,
which will be earmarked for priority after the first stable release of GHex 4.

Blockers for beta:

 - HexBufferIface (and to a lesser extent, GtkHex and HexDocument): things
   need to cook a bit more to ensure the API will be stable before moving to
   beta. This GObject Interface is quite new, and I want to ensure the API is not
   missing anything glaring before locking it into place for beta.

Blockers for stable release:

 - Update the help documentation.

 - Auto-highlights (ie, from searches) are sometimes not redrawn properly
   after a window resize.

 - Paste Special can sometimes crash when a certain combination of available
   MIME types is advertised to GHex from other applications.

Other known issues to be addressed in a future version:

 - Assertion errors upon exit - you may see assertion errors like the
   following:

(ghex:28200): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: 14:36:13.411: instance of invalid non-instantiatable type '-g-type-private--GTypeFlags'

(ghex:28200): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: 14:36:13.412: g_signal_handler_disconnect: assertion 'G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE (instance)' failed

(ghex:28200): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: 14:36:13.412: g_object_unref: assertion 'G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed

   I am told this may be a bug in GTK relating to the context menu.

 - Users have requested other features as well. Some will be implemented, some
   will not, and some will be taken under advisement.
   See https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/ghex/-/issues for some discussions.

By way of final note, the first stable release of GHex 4 will likely be
"4.x.0", with "x" being the contemporary GNOME release target. Eg, 4.43.0
would be the recommended release to couple with GNOME 43.

As GHex is part of the GNOME Extra Apps family, it is not mandatory for it to
follow the naming convention of its major version number matching the GNOME
release.  Since it also includes a library, libgtkhex-4, the "4.x" major
version number is meaningful, and I would rather keep it in place.
