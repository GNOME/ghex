ghex gtk4-port
==============

This is an ongoing effort to port the venerable ghex application to GTK4.

Please note that this is NOT working code! Work so far has mostly been on the
GtkHex widget itself.

If you are brave enough to test the WIP, first run meson as per usual, and
then head into the 'src' directory, and run `make STUB`.

You can then run ./STUB or ./debug-test.sh to try out the port of the GtkHex
widget thus far.
