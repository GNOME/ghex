GHex - 4.alpha.1 - GTK4 port
============================

This is an ongoing effort to port the venerable GNOME hex editor, GHex, to
GTK4.

By trying out this pre-release of GHex 4.x, you are in effect volunteering
yourself to be part of the testing community. Welcome!

If that is not something you would like to do, you should stick with GHex 3.x
for the time being.

Please see the NEWS file for important information on this alpha release.

Please report any issues at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/ghex/issues/  - and
kindly ensure you report the issue specifically against the "gtk4-port"
branch.

Thanks in advance for your anticipated understanding.
