 * manipulated at the backend by different backends.
 *
 * Once a file has been loaded into the buffer, it can be read, written
 * to file, etc.
 *
 * #HexBuffer makes reference to the "payload," which is the size of the
 * substantive data in the buffer, not counting items like padding, a gap,
 * etc. (all dependent upon the underlying implementation).
