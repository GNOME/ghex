/**
 * HexBuffer: 
 * 
 * #HexBuffer is an interface which can be implemented to act as a buffer
 * for [class@Hex.Document] data. This allows for a #HexDocument to be
 * manipulated by different backends.
 *
 * Once a file has been loaded into the buffer, it can be read, written
 * to file, etc.
 *
 * #HexBuffer makes reference to the "payload," which is the size of the
 * substantive data in the buffer, not counting items like padding, a gap,
 * etc. (all dependent upon the underlying implementation).
 *
 * Most clients who just want to create an spin up a #HexBuffer object should
 * look to the [func@Hex.Buffer.util_new] utility function as a starting
 * point, and then manipulate the returned #HexBuffer object with the methods
 * documented herein.

 * and the system supports plugins as a whole but cannot load that specified
