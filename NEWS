==============
GHex 4.alpha.1
==============

This is the first alpha GHex release featuring GTK 4 support. It is close to a
rewrite in most areas, but some areas, such as the hex-document portion of the
gtkhex library, are more or less straight ports to the new APIs.

As a result, this will require some substantial testing and translation
updates.

I have tried to write new GHex code in such a way that it is cleaner, easier
to follow, and more commented than the old code that has been straight-ported.
I was not able to do as substantial a reorganization of the old code as I
would have liked for this alpha, but efforts will be ongoing. One of my goals
is to make this code more hacker-friendly in general, especially to newcomers.

Visibly to the end user, some new features include:

 - More modern and up-to-date look and feel, consistent with the GNOME HIG.
 - Tabbed interface.
 - Dark Mode (by default, the GTK system default is used, but can be
   overridden with a checkbox and a switch in the Preferences dialog).
 - Custom clipboard data, for less error-prone copying and pasting of binary
   data; this will fall back to plaintext when unavailable.

I'll break up the known issues into two categories:  items I would consider to
be blockers for a stable release, and other known issues, which will be
earmarked for priority after the first stable release of GHex 4.x.

Blockers for stable release:
 - Fixes for lots of UI imperfections, including widgets not grabbing focus
   when they should; also there are some obvious missing keybindings.
 - The offsets column shows some spurious lines when a file is first loaded.
   This can be cleared by clicking anywhere on the hex widget to clear it.
 - The hex-document portion of the gtkhex library is a relic of code written
   in the 90s, and it shows. Some more sophisticated caching and memory
   management is in order as opposed to simply calling g_malloc on basically
   the entirety of the file being opened. This can cause unstable and
   unpredictable behaviour when very large files are loaded.

Other known issues to be addressed in a future version:
 - The layout manager does not currently work perfectly with group types other
   than 'byte'; the allocation of space is poor.
