NOTE ON DUCKTYPE YELP FILES:

Dated: 5 January 2022
by: Logan Rathbone <poprocks@gmail.com>

These raw .duck files get converted to standard .page files.

If you have the ``ducktype'' program and all of its dependencies installed
(via: `pip3 install mallard-ducktype`), you may simply run `make` in this
directory to build the .page files, and copy them to the `C` directory below.

This should be done after any core help file changes *before* pushing to
gitlab.

The reason this is done manually here and not as part of every build process,
is that this ducktype system does not seem to be idiomatic within the GNOME
ecosystem at this time, or very widely utilized at all. So, I did not want
this process to blockade people from being able to build GHex with all of its
help files included as a result of missing some obscure dependencies.

As well, since this ducktype program is not widely adopted, I wouldn't be
surprised if it went the way of the dodo in the next couple of years, so there
is no point in putting all kinds of (customized, at that) meson infrastructure
in place now, only to have to blow it away if ducktype becomes unmaintained.
If that happens, we'll just quietly delete this directory and start manually
editing the .page files on a go-forward basis.
