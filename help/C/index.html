<A NAME="introduction"></A>2. Introduction</H2>
</P>
GHex (the <B>G</B>NOME <B>Hex </B>Editor) is a small tool that enables
you, its user, to view and edit contents of any file in hex and as ASCII
text. It is supposed to be a part of the GNOME desktop environment and
tries to nicely integrate with its other components and conform to the
general guidelines for GNOME applications.
</P>

<H2>
<A NAME="use"></A>3. Use</H2>
<P>When starting GHex, it will pop up a window with nothing but a
<A HREF="#menubar">menubar</A>. When a file is loaded, its contents will
be displayed below the menubar in an area that will occupy the largest part
of the window. The contents are displayed in both hex and ascii at once, with
hexadecimal values on the left and the corresponding ascii representation of
those bytes on the right-hand side of the display.
</P>

a buffer and displaying it immediately in a view.</LI>

correspond to a given format.</LI>

the buffer to a file with this name.</LI>

<H4>
Editing a file</H4>
<P>You can move around the file using the arrow keys, the numeric keypad,
the scrollbar on the left of the buffer display or by clicking into display
with a mouse. Clicking into the hex or ascii display will activate hex
or ascii editing mode. The active display is indicated by a full cursor,
while the other one displays cursor as an outline.
</P>
<P>In ascii mode, you can edit the file pretty much as with any text editor.
In hex mode, you can change the value of the nibble (four bits, a half of a
byte) under the cursor with keys '0' .. '9' and 'a' .. 'f', representing the
hex digits.
</P>
<H4>
<A NAME="findnreplace"></A>Finding and replacing data</H4>
<P>Selecting <I>Find </I>from the <I>Edit </I>menu will bring up the Find
Dialog. It allows you to search the file for a string that you can enter
in either hex or ascii. To find an ascii string, simply enter it into the
entry widget and click on the <I>Find Next </I>or <I>Find Previous</I>
button. You can choose in which form (either hex or ASCII) you wish to
enter the search string with the two radio buttons below the entry widget.
</P>
<P>Replacing data is much alike, except that you have to enter both a
string to be found and a string that will replace the found value. The
<I>Find Next </I>button will search for the next occurence of the string
from the first entry widget, the <I>Replace </I>button will replace the
data if the cursor is on the beginning of a string that equals to the
searched-for one and then search for the next occurence, if the cursor is
not positioned on the beginning of the searched-for string, it will try to
find the next occurence of it, but will not replace that one. Finally,
the <I>Replace All </I>button will replace all occurences of the searched-for
string from the current cursor position to the end of the file.
</P>
<H4>
<A NAME="converter"></A>Base Conversion Dialog</H4>
<P>Shows you up to four bytes of data as their binary, decimal, hexadecimal
and ASCII&nbsp;representation. The values automatically update when you
change data in any entry. 'Get cursor value' button grabs the value of
the data under the cursor (either byte, word or long word, depending on the
groupping setting).

<b>Editing settings:</b> here you can set the maximum number of changes that can be
undone and pick the format the the cursor offset will be shown at. This format
can be either decimal or hexadecimal or a custom printf style string containing
no other format specifiers but 'x', 'o' and 's'. You can also set whether
the hex editing widget will show an extra column with the offsets of
beginning of lines on the left.</LI>

Display settings: here you can set the default data grouping type and the
display font.</LI>

<LI>
