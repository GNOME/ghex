# GHex

GHex is a hex editor for the GNOME desktop.

GHex can load raw data from binary files and display them for editing in
a traditional hex editor view. The display is split in two columns, with
hexadecimal values in one column and the ASCII representation in the
other. GHex is a useful tool for working with raw data.
